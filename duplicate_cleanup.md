# Duplications in Codebase and Cleanup Plan

## 1. Input Simulator Duplication ✅

There were two input simulator implementations in the codebase:
- `src/input_simulator.py` - **DELETED**
- `src/environment/input_simulator.py` - **KEPT**

### Actions Taken:
- Verified that the environment version was being used by the game environment
- Deleted `src/input_simulator.py`
- No import updates needed as the code was using the correct imports

## 2. Network Model Duplication ✅

There were two similar neural network implementations:
- `src/model/network.py` - **DELETED** 
- `src/model/optimized_network.py` - **KEPT**

### Actions Taken:
- Verified that the agent was using the optimized version
- Deleted the unused `src/model/network.py`
- No import updates needed as the code was using the correct imports

## 3. Screen Capture Duplication ✅

Two screen capture implementations existed:
- `src/environment/screen_capture.py` - **DELETED**
- `src/environment/optimized_capture.py` - **KEPT**

### Actions Taken:
- Verified that the game environment was using the optimized version
- Updated `src/environment/__init__.py` to import and expose the optimized version
- Deleted the unused `src/environment/screen_capture.py`

## 4. Implementation Plan

✅ Checked all imports to understand dependencies
✅ Verified the optimized versions contained all functionality from the base versions
✅ Updated import statements in dependent files (only needed for __init__.py)
✅ Deleted the duplicate files
⬜ Test the system to ensure it works correctly after changes

## 5. Other Potential Duplications to Investigate

- Check if there are duplicated utility functions across different modules
- Verify if game_env.py contains functionality that overlaps with other modules
- Look for duplicated constants or configuration values that could be centralized
