# Cities Skylines 2 Agent - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Input Simulator and Action Executor

We identified and fixed several issues with the action execution system:

- Fixed a mismatch between the `Controller` class and actual input methods by modifying the `ActionExecutor` class to correctly use the `KeyboardInput` and `MouseInput` classes
- Updated the action execution code to properly check the type of input controller and use the appropriate methods
- Fixed the `InputSimulator` initialization to use the correct input classes

### 2. Mouse Input

The mouse input system had several issues that we addressed:

- Resolved issues with mouse click functionality
- Fixed mouse drag operations to work more reliably

### 3. Action Format

We improved the handling of different action formats:

- Fixed how dictionary-style actions are processed
- Enhanced the key press action format to work with the correct keyboard input method
- Improved error handling in the action execution process

## Testing & Verification

We created a comprehensive test script (`src/test_fixes.py`) with several test functions:

1. `test_window_focus()`: Tests the ability to find and focus the game window
2. `test_mouse_input()`: Tests basic mouse movement, clicks, and drag operations
3. `test_keyboard_input()`: Tests key press functionality
4. `test_action_execution()`: Tests the action execution system with various action formats
5. `test_environment_step()`: Tests the complete environment step function (requires more configuration)

## Results

Our tests confirmed that the key functionality is now working:

- Key presses: 7/8 test keys successful (escape intentionally blocked as a safety feature)
- Mouse movements: Successfully moving to specified positions
- Mouse drag: Successfully dragging between points
- Action execution: Successfully executing both dictionary-style and direct actions

## Remaining Issues

Some minor issues remain to be addressed:

1. Window focus still has reliability issues, with some focus techniques failing
2. There are non-critical warnings in the mouse click functionality related to the Win32 API
3. Complete environment integration testing requires proper configuration of the HardwareConfig object

## Next Steps

1. Fix the window focus techniques, particularly the missing `ASFW_ANY` constant
2. Address the Win32 API issues in the mouse click functionality
3. Create a proper configuration setup for environment testing

These fixes should significantly improve the agent's ability to take actions in the Cities Skylines 2 environment, enabling proper reinforcement learning training.
